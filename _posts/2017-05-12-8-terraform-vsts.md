When we run terraform from VSTS we need to ensure that we maintain the state file - and its backup - in a central location.

terraform supports storing state in blob storage.

- To enable state to be persisted to blob we need to add a provider block to main file

        main.tf

        terraform {
           backend "azurerm" {
             storage_account_name = "statefile01012"
             container_name       = "statefile01012"
             key                  = "prod.terraform.tfstate"
           }
        }

- We can then push this to github

For consistency lets push it to the GitHub repository TestWebTerraform.

- Create a new Build

- Connect it to our GitHub repository

- Start with an empty process

- Lets use our Azure-Hosted-Agents for performing this build

- We are going to use a variable to hold the access key for our state blob container.  Lets set it.

- Add a new Terraform Task to your Phase 1 - you may need to add this to your VSTS.

- Configure this task as our terraform init.

You will note that we are passing a parameter into init.  This is set via an environment variable and is used to allow us to connect to our blob storage.

The parameters are:
init -backend-config="access_key=$(v_access_key)"

- Create another task as our terraform plan

- Create another task as our terraform apply

      apply  -auto-approve 

![](/images/New-IaC-Release-09.png)

- Lets give it a meaningful name - BuildWebInfra - and save it

- Letw queue a new build

![](/images/New-IaC-Release-10.png)

- And look at the Logs

- After a successful run we can take a look at the state file.

This is equivalent to the state file which was stored on our filesystem when we ran from our command line.

-  Great, all done!
