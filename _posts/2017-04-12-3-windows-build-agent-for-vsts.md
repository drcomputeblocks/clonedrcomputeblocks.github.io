title: "Azure DevOps: #3 Visual Studio Team Services Build Agent"
date: 2017-04-13

When you sign up for Visual Studio Team Services you are allocated a given amount of build/release hours for free.  After this you will have to either buy more or create your own Build Agent.

- Select Windows based Build Agent for VSTS from the Azure Marketplace

*I wont walk through creating a VM.  But the significant screen is below.*

- Get hold of your _[Personal Access Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=vsts)_

- Which you can then put into the VSTS Settings.

- It achieved this - pretty obviously - by running a custom script against the VM.

- Run the agent installation manually.

- We can now return to our build definition and select this agent pool

- But it fails

      ## Error 1
      No agent found in pool Azure-Hosted-Agents which satisfies the specified demands:
      msbuild
      visualstudio
      vstest
      Agent.Version -gtVersion 2.115.0

To resolve this install Visual Studio Community on the host.

- You can see what capabilities are installed on the build agent by going to the Capabilities link to the right hand side of the agent.

- Rerun the build against the new agent
