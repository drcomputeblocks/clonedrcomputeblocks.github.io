title: "Azure DevOps: #3 Visual Studio Team Services Build Agent"

When you sign up for Visual Studio Team Services you are allocated a given amount of build/release hours for free.  After this you will have to either buy more or create your own Build Agent.

- Select Windows based Build Agent for VSTS from the Azure Marketplace

*I wont walk through creating a VM.  But the significant screen is below.*

- Get hold of your _[Personal Access Token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=vsts)_

- Which you can then put into the VSTS Settings.

- It achieved this - pretty obviously - by running a custom script against the VM.

- Run the agent installation manually.

      PS C:\agent> .\config.cmd
      Connect:
      Enter server URL > https://dermot-singlepane.visualstudio.com/
      Enter authentication type (press enter for PAT) >
      Enter personal access token > 
      Connecting to server ...
      >> Register Agent:
      Enter agent pool (press enter for default) > Azure-Hosted-Agents
      Enter agent name (press enter for vstsagentvm1) >
      Scanning for tool capabilities.
      Connecting to the server.
      Successfully added the agent
      Testing agent connection.
      Enter work folder (press enter for _work) >
      2018-07-31 11:24:44Z: Settings Saved.
      Enter run agent as service? (Y/N) (press enter for N) > Y
      Enter User account to use for the service (press enter for NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE) >

- We can now return to our build definition and select this agent pool

- But it fails

      ## Error 1
      No agent found in pool Azure-Hosted-Agents which satisfies the specified demands:
      msbuild
      visualstudio
      vstest
      Agent.Version -gtVersion 2.115.0

To resolve this install Visual Studio Community on the host.

- You can see what capabilities are installed on the build agent by going to the Capabilities link to the right hand side of the agent.

- Rerun the build against the new agent
