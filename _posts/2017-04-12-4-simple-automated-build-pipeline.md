The purpose of this series is to walk through how to create a CI/CD pipeline using:
- Visual Studio
- Visual Studio Team Services
- Azure
- Terraform

This uses the app that was published to GitHub as part of the Publish A Very Basic App To GitHub article.

## Create a new project in Visual Studio Team Services

- Create a new Project.

This will trigger a build each time you update your GitHub repository.
