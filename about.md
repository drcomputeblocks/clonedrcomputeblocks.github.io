My name is **Dermot Reynolds**, and this is my personal blog where I document some of the less well known or understood aspects of Cloud.

I have over 25 years experience in IT from developer to Oracle DBA to Sysadmin to Architect to CTO.

I am an Azure Certified Solutions Architect and would regard myself an expert in designing and implementing innovative solutions.
